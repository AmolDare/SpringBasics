DEV PROCESS
 1.Create java class and annotate with @Configuration
  -Indicates that a class declares one or more @Bean methods and may be processed by the Spring container 
  to generate bean definitions and service requests for those beans at runtime,
 2.Add component scanning support by @ComponentScan(optional step) 
   -Either basePackageClasses() or basePackages() (or its alias value()) may be specified to define specific packages to scan.
   If specific packages are not defined, scanning will occur from the package of the class that declares this annotation.
  Note that the <context:component-scan> element has an annotation-config attribute; however, this annotation does not.
  3.Add @PropertySource("property file name") to inject properties 

 4.Read spring config class
 5.Retrieve bean
